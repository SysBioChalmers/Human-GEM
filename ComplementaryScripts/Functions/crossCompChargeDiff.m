function charge_diff = crossCompChargeDiff(model,rxns,reqFormula)
%crossCompChargeDiff  Determine compartment charge changes caused by rxns.
%
%   This function calculates the net charge change in each compartment
%   caused by each given reaction based on the charges and compartments of 
%   metabolites involved in the reaction.
%
% USAGE:
%
%   charge_diff = crossCompChargeDiff(model,rxns,reqFormula);
%
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   model   Model structure.
%
%   rxns    (Optional, default is all model.rxns) A list of model reaction
%           IDs (or rxn indices) to be evaluated.
%
%   reqFormula   (Optional, default FALSE) If TRUE, reactions involving at
%                least one metabolite that does not have an associated
%                formula (in .metFormulas) will not be evaluated (i.e., the
%                result for that reaction will contain NaNs).
%                If FALSE, then all reactions provided will be evaluated.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%   charge_diff   Structure containing the following fields:
%
%                 .mat    An R x C matrix, where R = numer of input rxns
%                         and C = number of model compartments. For each
%                         reaction, the net change in charge of each
%                         compartment is given in the corresponding column.
%                        
%                      NOTE: If reqFormula is TRUE, then rows corresponding
%                            to rxns involving met(s) without formulas will
%                            contain all NaN's.
%
%                 .rxns   A list of reaction IDs corresponding to the rows
%                         of charge_diff.mat
%
%                 .comps  A list of compartment abbreviations corresponding
%                         to the columns of charge_diff.mat.
%
%                 .compNames   A list of compartment names corresponding
%                              to the columns of charge_diff.mat
