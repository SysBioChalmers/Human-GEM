% PURPOSE: Script for analyzing/curating the inner mitochondrial matrix
%          compartment "[i]". This is done in a few steps:
%
%          1. Remove duplicated electron transport chain reactions
%             - These reactions are duplicated because one version comes
%               from Recon3D, whereas the other from HMR. The HMR version
%               of these rxns will be kept, and the Recon3D version
%               deleted.
%             - Due to proton/compartment differences, these reactions were
%               not identified previously as duplicated, and therefore are
%               removed here.
%             - The rxnAssoc.mat file is updated accordingly.
%
%          2. Two unused/dead-end rxns were constrained to zero, and
%             flagged for future deletion.
%             - Both of these reactions came from Recon3D, and appeared to
%               be related to the proton gradient:
%                   r1330  'H+[m] => H+[c] + Proton-Gradient[m]'
%                   r1331  'H+[c] => H+[s] + Proton-Gradient[c]'
%
%          3. Some rxn bounds were updated to prevent energy-generating
%             proton pumping (M to C)
%
%          4. All electrogenic rxns involving proton transport between
%             mitochondria and cytoplasm were updated to take place between
%             the mitochondria and inner mitochondrial membrane, "i".
%
%          5. Update the bounds on ATP-driven transport reactions to
%             prevent generation of ATP.
%             - These reactions should not be reversible, as they lead to
%               artificial production.
