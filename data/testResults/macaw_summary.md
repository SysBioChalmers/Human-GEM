Starting dead-end test...
 - Found 1514 dead-end metabolites.
 - Found 1319 reactions incapable of sustaining steady-state fluxes in either direction due to these dead-ends.
 - Found 1977 reversible reactions that can only carry steady-state fluxes in a single direction due to dead-ends.
Starting duplicate test...
 - Skipping redox duplicates because no redox_pairs and/or proton_ids were provided.
 - Found 447 reactions that were some type of duplicate:
   - 0 were completely identical to at least one other reaction.
   - 13 involve the same metabolites but go in the opposite direction or have the opposite reversibility as at least one other reaction.
   - 447 involve the same metabolites but with different coefficients as at least one other reaction.
