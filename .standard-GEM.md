=================

For details about the [aims](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM/wiki/Aims,-scope-and-terminology#aims), [scope](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM/wiki/Aims,-scope-and-terminology#scope), and [use case](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM/wiki/Use-case) of this standard see the [wiki pages of the `standard-GEM` repository](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM/wiki).

### Terminology
To facilitate understading, the definitions used throughout this guide are copied below  [from the wiki](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM/wiki/Aims,-scope-and-terminology#terminology). For easier differentiation, we have associated colors to each of them.

Based on the ISO guidelines, tweaked for easy understanding.

### Instructions
This document serves as a checklist for creating an open source genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) on GitHub.  

- [x] 🟥 All GEMs that follow the `standard-GEM` must contain this file.  
This serves as a traceable adherence to the standard, manually confirmed by the original authors. This file must be edited only with [checkmarks](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists), in order to support automatic parsing and validation of this file. Some of the checkmarks are pre-applied based on the contents of the `standard-GEM` template repository. GEM authors have the responsibility of checking that their model repository does follow the guidelines entirely.  
With further updates to `standard-GEM`, one should paste over the new version of this file, and see that the changes in the new guidelines are met.

Repository creation
-------------------
- [x] 🟨 Navigate to [standard-GEM](https://github.com/MetabolicAtlas/standard-GEM/) and click on the button `Use this template`  
The `standard-GEM` template can be used to initiate a repository. This will copy the contents of the _master_ branch into the new repository, which can be either private or public.

- [x] 🟥 Pick a repository name  
The name must be either a common name, KEGG organism, or taxonomy-derived short name, followed by the extension `-GEM` or `-GSMM`. The `-GEM` extension is preferred to ease pronunciation. The name can be prefixed by an abbreviation, eg `ec` (enzyme constrained), `sec` (with secretory pathways), `mito` (with mitochondrion pathways), `pro` (with protein structures).  
Example: `ecYeast-GEM`

- [x] 🟥 Pick a repository description  
The description must include the taxonomic classification in full.  
Example: `The consensus GEM for Saccharomyces cerevisiae`

- [x] 🟥 Add repository topic  
The topic `standard-GEM` must be added. Other topics like `genome-scale-models`, `systems-biology` can be added. Having this topic on your repository enables automatic finding using the GitHub API, and automatic validation of the standard.  
Topics are not copied from `standard-GEM`, so they need to be added manually.

- [x] 🟨 Add a repository URL  
The URL can be the _doi_.


Repository workflow
-------------------
- [ ] 🟥 Git branches  
The GEM repository must have at least two branches: _master_ and _develop_.

- [ ] 🟥 Releases  
Releases must use the tag format `X.X.X` where X are numbers, according to [semantic versioning principles](https://semver.org/). The last field (“patch”) can also be used to indicate changes to the repository that do not actually change the GEM itself. The use of a `v` before the version number (`v1.0`) is [discouraged](https://semver.org/#is-v123-a-semantic-version).

- [ ] 🟨 Commits  
Commit messages can follow the style of semantic commits.


File tree
---------
`/` signifies the root of the repository.  
`.keep` files are used to indicate that the empty folder should not be ignored by _git_ - without it _git_ would simply not want to version empty directories. Once folders are not empty, it is okay to remove these files.

- [x] 🟥 `/.gitignore`  
The repository must contain a `/.gitignore` file. This generic [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) was prepared for multiple programming languages. While it does not require modification, it can be further adapted to the needs of the repository.

- [x] 🟥 `/.github`  
The repository must contain a `/.github` folder, in which the contributing guidelines, code of conduct, issue templates and pull request templates must be placed. Defaults are provided and they do not require any modification.

- [x] 🟥 `/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`  
This file is provided by the template, but it is empty. It must be filled in with the adequate contributing guideline instructions; a good example is https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md.

- [x] 🟥 `/code/README.md`  
The repository must contain a `/code` folder. This folder must contain all the code used in generating the model. It must also include a `README.md` file that describes how the folder is organized.

- [ ] 🟥 `/data/README.md`  
The repository must contain a `/data` folder. This folder contains the data used in generating the model. It must also include a `README.md` file that describes how the folder is organized.

- [x] 🟥 `/model`  
The repository must contain `/model` folder.  
This folder must contain the model files, in multiple formats, according to the table below. As a general guideline, binary formats (`.mat`, `.xlsx`) must not exist on any other branches than _master_. The main reason for this is that binary files cannot be diff'ed, which means changes cannot be compared to previous versions, thus increasing the chance of errors. Moreover, with time, the size of the repository can create difficulties, and we cannot yet recommend storing these files with Git LFS, as it introducs complexity.  
For more information on the `sbtab` file format, see [sbtab.net](https://sbtab.net).  
All model files must be named the same as the repository, and with the appropriate extension.  
Example: `yeast-GEM.mat`

| Model file format | _master_ branch | _develop_ and other branches |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| JSON `.json`      | can             ||
| Matlab `.mat`     | should          | must not                     |
| sbtab `.tsv`      | can             ||
| Text file `.txt`  | must            ||
| Excel `.xlsx`     | must            | must not                     |
| SBML `.xml`       | must            ||
| YAML `.yml`       | must            ||


- [x] 🟥 `/LICENSE.md`  
The repository must contain a license file. The default license is [CC-BY 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Unless a different license is desired, the file does not require modification.

- [x] 🟥 `/README.md`  
The repository must contain a `README.md` file. A default file is provided, and the adequate contents must be filled in.  
The `/README.md` file must include a version badge. A default is provided in the file.  
Additionally, the `/README.md` file	should contain [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) badge. As soon as the first public release is in made, the repository must be archived via Zenodo, and the corresponding badge be updated. A default is provided in the file.  
The `/README.md` can contain a contact badge, for example [Gitter](https://gitter.io). When setting up the Gitter chat room, the GitHub activity should be synced with Gitter in order to see the latest updates of the repository in the chat room. A default for this badge is provided in the file.

- [x] 🟥 `/version.txt`  
The repository must contain this file, which is required for the version badge in the `/README.md`. The value refers to the version of the GEM, not of the `standard-GEM`. The value must be updated with each release.

- [x] 🟨 Files for continuous integration testing  
The repository can be set up for continuous integration testing using memote with eg. Travis CI (`.travis.yml`), Jenkins (`Jenkinsfile`), GitHub Actions (under `.github/workflows`).

- [ ] 🟨 _MEMOTE_ report  
The repository could contain a [MEMOTE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0446-y) report on the _master_ branch, in `.html` format.
