# Human-GEM

- Brief Model Description

This repository contains the latest version of the generic Human Metabolic model, humanGEM, which is a genome-scale metabolic model of the generic human cell.

- Abstract:

Human genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are an important tool for the study of human health and disease, providing a scaffold upon which many different types of data can be analyzed in an integrative manner. Despite advancements in the size and complexity of human GEMs, there currently exists the need for a highly accurate, standardized, and manually curated model of human metabolism. Here, we update the previous version of the Human Metabolic Reaction model (
2) to humanGEM, in a process that includes the addition of new reactions, metabolites, and genes, followed by extensive curation. The objective of humanGEM is to serve as a continually maintained “gold-standard” of generic human GEMs, further enabling integrative and mechanistic studies of human metabolism.
